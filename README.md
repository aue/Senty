# Senty
Instant, offline sentiment analysis for what you type.

## What it does
Senty is a Google Chrome Extension that shows you the tone of what you type into any text box on the web. By using an offline [sentiment module](https://github.com/thisandagain/sentiment) as a building block, Senty shows an aggregate score and the positive and negative terms that contribute to it as you type. As a tool, this can help communities communicate with a better understanding of the tonality and expression of their own words.
